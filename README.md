# Token-Terminator

Upon entering a token, this software will attempt to leave all servers, and should succeed as long as your not the owner, and will then join 100 servers.

These 100 servers come from the invite codes in servers.txt , They all worked at the time of releasing but I'm sure a few might stop, so feel free to make your own list or whatever..

When leaving and joining 100 servers in a matter of seconds, the discord account will get locked. If unverified, it'll most likely ask for a phonenumber to verify and will limit anything else, if it's verified it should lock the account!

This is a demonstation, DO NOT USE IT, this is against the tos and will ruin your account so don't use it guys!
